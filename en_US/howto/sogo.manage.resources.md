# SOGo: Manage resources (Free/Busy)

[TOC]

> This tutorial is a slight rewritten of SOGo wiki tutorial for iRedMail:
> [Use Resources with SOGo](http://wiki.sogo.nu/ResourceConfiguration).

SOGo supports the management of resources like meeting rooms. A resource has,
just like a person, a calendar, an email address and may be invited to events.
The big difference is that resources auto accept invitations.

When you mark a mail user as a meeting room resource, SOGo will display its
Free/Busy info when you invite this user in a calendar event.


## OpenLDAP backend

### Add missing LDAP schema files

We need 2 new LDAP schema files, you can click links below to download them:

* [calresource](./files/sogo/calresource.schema). It's defined in
  [IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-cal-resource-schema-03.txt)
  (not final yet). Contributed by Martin Lehman on the
  [SOGo mailing list](https://www.mail-archive.com/users@sogo.nu/msg05186.html)
  (in 29 April 2011).
* [calentry](./files/sogo/calentry.schema), defined in RFC 2739.

Upload downloaded schema files to iRedMail server which runs OpenLDAP backend,
copy them to default schema directory:

* On RHEL/CentOS, it's `/etc/openldap/schema/`
* On Debian/Ubuntu, it's `/etc/ldap/schema/`
* On FreeBSD, it's `/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/`
* On OpenBSD, it's `/etc/openldap/schema/`

Edit OpenLDAP config file `slapd.conf` with your favourite text editor, add 2
new `include` directives right after the `iredmail.schema` line like
below:

* On RHEL/CentOS, it's `/etc/openldap/slapd.conf`
* On Debian/Ubuntu, it's `/etc/ldap/slapd.conf`
* On FreeBSD, it's `/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf`
* On OpenBSD, it's `/etc/openldap/slapd.conf`

!!! attention

    Please make sure you're using the correct schema directory.

```
# this line already exists
include /etc/openldap/schema/iredmail.schema

# Add below 2 new lines
include /etc/openldap/schema/calresource.schema
include /etc/openldap/schema/calentry.schema
```

Since we don't use any new ldap attribute names in LDAP query filter, no index
required for new attribute names.

Now restart OpenLDAP service.

### Add missing settings in SOGo config file

SOGo needs 2 parameters to understand which LDAP attributes it should query
to understand the resources:

* `KindFieldName`: specify the LDAP attribute name which stores resource type.

    SOGo will try to determine if the value of the field corresponds to either
    "group", "location" or "thing". If thatâ€™s the case, SOGo will consider the
    returned entry to be a resource.

* `MultipleBookingsFieldName`: specify the LDAP attribute name ewhich stores
  multiple booking type.

    The value of this LDAP attribute is the maximum number of concurrent events
    to which a resource can be part of at any point in time.

    * If this is set to __0__, or if the attribute is __missing__, it means no limit.
    * If set to __-1__, no limit is imposed but the resource will be marked as
      busy the first time it is booked.

Edit SOGo config file `sogo.conf`, add these 2 new parameters in the global
address book section like below:

* On RHEL/CentOS, it's `/etc/sogo/sogo.conf`
* On Debian/Ubuntu, it's `/etc/sogo/sogo.conf`
* On FreeBSD, it's `/usr/local/etc/sogo/sogo.conf`
* On OpenBSD, it's `/etc/sogo/sogo.conf`

```
    SOGoUserSources = (
        ...
        {
            // Used for global address book
            type = ldap;
            id = global_addressbook;
            ...

            // Add below 2 lines
            KindFieldName = "Kind";
            MultipleBookingsFieldName = "MultipleBookings";
        }
        ...
```

Now restart SOGo service.

### Testing

We use mail domain name `example.com` for example below, you need to replace it
by your real domain name during testing.

* Create a testing mail user with iRedAdmin. for example, user `meetingroom@example.com`.
* Install package `ldapvi` on iRedMail server, then run command `ldapvi` like this:

!!! attention

    * `ldapvi` is like vi/vim text editor for editing LDIF data directly.
    * You need to replace `dc=xx,dc=xx` by the real LDAP suffix.
    * It will ask you to input password of `cn=manager,dc=xx,dc=xx`.

```
ldapvi -D 'cn=manager,dc=xx,dc=xx' -b 'o=domains,dc=xx,dc=xx' -W "mail=meetingroom@example.com"
```

In the ldapvi editor, you should see full LDIF data of user
`meetingroom@example.com`. Please append few lines for this user:

```
objectClass: CalendarResource
objectClass: calEntry
Kind: location
MultipleBookings: 1
```

Save your change and quit ldapvi (just like quitting vi/vim text editor).

* Login to SOGo webmail as `meetingroom@example.com`, then click the `Calendar`
  icon on top-right corner.

* Click the three-dot icon beside `Personal Calendar`, and choose `Sharing...`.
* In the popup modal window, click `Any Authenticated User`, set values of
  options `Public`, `Confidential` and `Private` to `View the Date & Time`.
  Save your changes.

* Now logout of SOGo webmail, re-login as a different user under same domain.
* Create a new testing event, invite `meetingroom@example.com` as attendee.
* Create second testing event in same day as first event, invite
  `meetingroom@example.com` as attendee, this time SOGo will indicate
  `meetingroom@example.com` is busy in the time window of first event.
