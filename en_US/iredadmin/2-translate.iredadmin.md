# iRedAdmin: Translate iRedAdmin to your local language

iRedAdmin-Pro language files are published on github repository:
[iredmail/iredadmin-pro-translation](https://github.com/iredmail/iredadmin-pro-translation)

How to help translate:

* Fork the github repository
* Translate file `<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/iredadmin.po`
* Send us a pull request.

If there's no directory for your language, feel free to create it, then copy
file `iredadmin.po` on top directory to your directory.

We will convert translated file and commit to the repository again, you
can download it and override the file in your iRedAdmin-Pro directory, then
restart Apache or uwsgi (if you're running Nginx) service.

Your help is greatly appreciated. :)
