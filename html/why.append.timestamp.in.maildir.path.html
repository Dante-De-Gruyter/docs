<p>iRedMail appends a timestamp to user's maildir path by default, people asked
many times why we do this, and here's why. :)</p>
<p>Think about this situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Employee <strong>Michael Jordan</strong> has email address <code>mj@domain.ltd</code>. Without timestamp
  in maildir path, his maildir path should be <code>/var/vmail/vmail1/domain.ltd/mj/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael left company someday, your company removed his mail account, and
  scheduled to remove his mailbox in certain years (either according to local
  law to keep it, or you just want to save a backup copy).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new talent, <strong>Mike Jackson</strong>, joined your company, and he wants to use
  <code>mj@domain.ltd</code> since it is not used by anyone else right now. You created it
  for him. Without timestamp in maildir path, his maildir path will be
  same as <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>'s which is <code>/var/vmail/vmail1/domain.ltd/mj/</code>.
  In this case, <strong>Mike Jackson</strong> will see all old emails left in <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>'s
  mailbox.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid this issue, iRedMail appends a timestamp in maildir path to make sure
all users have their own unique maildir paths.</p>
